We offer loans to fill your unpredictable financial needs.Most of the time, these come up without a warning and can be anything, like a sudden medical emergency, festival shopping, paying your EMIs/bills, etc.

creditlab.in was started by a group of individuals from prestigious institutions such as IIT, IIM, and among others,
to solve the issue of easy credit among young professionals in India. The team feels that the Indian demography
has a large population of urban young adults that spends a lot online and offline. For such an enormous ecosystem, the need 
for urgent  finance for purchase requirements is highly under-served. An appropriate focus towards tech-based credit
evaluation can both help this demographic segment significantly and also fuel the Indian economy by encouraging responsible spending behavior among individuals.
