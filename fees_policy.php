        <h3>i. Key Principles</h3>
        <p>In compliance with the referred circular and Directions issued by RBI, the key principles based on which the terms and conditions for penal charges have been framed are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The intent of levying penal /charges is essentially to inculcate a sense of credit discipline and such charges are not meant to be used as a revenue enhancement tool over and above the contracted rate of interest.</li>
            <li>Penalty, if charged, for non-compliance of material terms and conditions of loan contract by the borrower shall be treated as ‘penal charges’ and shall not be levied in the form of ‘penal interest’.</li>
            <li>There shall be no capitalisation of penal charges i.e., no further interest computed on such charges.</li>
            <li>No additional component shall be added to the rate of interest.</li>
            <li>The quantum of penal charges shall be reasonable and commensurate with the noncompliance of material terms and conditions of loan contract without being discriminatory within a particular loan / product category.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>ii. Structure of Penal Charges</h3>
        <p>Currently, penal charges are only to be levied if repayments are not made by the respective due date and penal charges are not envisaged for any other non-compliances related to other terms and conditions of the loan.</p>
        <p>Further, the quantum and reason for penal charges shall be clearly disclosed to the customers in the loan agreement and most important terms & conditions / Key Fact Statement (KFS), in addition to being disclosed on the Company website (pursuant to RBI Guidelines on Digital Lending dated September 02, 2022 and RBI Circular dated April 15, 2024 on Key Fact Statements for Loans and Advances) and the loan agreement. In addition to reminders sent to borrowers for non-compliance of material terms and conditions of loan, the Borrowers shall also be communicated about the applicable penal charges alongwith the instance of levy of penal charges and the reason thereof.</p>

        <h2>7. ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR)</h2>
        <p>The Company will disclose the annualized effective rate (APR), which represents the total cost of the digital loan to the borrower in the loan documentation. The APR represents the annualized effective cost of the digital loan, expressed as a percentage, and includes not only the nominal interest rate but also all applicable fees and charges associated with the loan. This ensures that borrowers have a clear and standardized understanding of the total cost of credit over a one-year period, allowing for informed comparison with other loan products."</p>
